Some small projects in Lua + Love2D, that can work as tutorials for someone that wants to learn programming.

## Examples
The examples are made in Lua with the Love2D framework, because i think that Lua is an easy language to begin programming in.
I want the examples to be of such applications, so that the person learning programming has encountered them before, and it is easy to see the use of them.
